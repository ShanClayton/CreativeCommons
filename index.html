          <p><strong>Content owned by your users</strong><br />
          If you enable your users to apply CC licenses to their content on your platform, your primary goal should be ensuring they understand the basics of how the licenses work, especially because the licenses are irrevocable. You can decide
          which of the six license types and two public domain tools you want to enable users to apply and then make sure to mark the content to identify which license applies to which content. In nearly all cases, this content remains owned by the
          user, and the platform gets the rights to host it via the CC license that is applied or via a separate license in the terms of service.<br />

          <p><strong>In the most simple and accessible terms possible, the TOS should explain how CC licensing works for content creators on the platform.</strong><br />
          <br />
          <strong>The TOS should make it clear that users of the platform can reuse CC-licensed content according to the terms and conditions of the applicable license.</strong><br />
          Many users will not be familiar with CC licensing, so it is best to spell this out explicitly. You can also link to information that explains how CC licenses work in more detail. If the TOS include other provisions that restrict the way
          content is used on the site, then providing certainty that CC-licensed content may be used according to the license terms is particularly important. See Additional restrictions for more information. See Model platform TOS provisions for an
          example.

          <p><strong>Additional restrictions</strong><br />
          Many TOS include restrictions on how content on the platform may be used. Imposing additional terms that contradict the CC license confuses users and undermines the point of license standardization. CC strongly discourages this practice.<br />

          Your platform may have extra restrictions that are not intended for CC-licensed content. For example, a platform may include terms that limit use of the platform to noncommercial purposes. In these cases, we recommend adding language that
          clarifies that these and other restrictions do not apply to CC-licensed content.<br />

          At the end of the day, we want to ensure that people who come across CC-licensed work can trust that they can use that work under the terms of the CC license. When extra restrictions are imposed on CC-licensed content â€“ whether by changing
          the license terms themselves or by imposing new contractual restrictions via terms of service
